# Norse Mythology

A passion project created to bring back the positivity, interest and mysticism of the old Norse mythology of Aesir and Vanir, of Ragnarok and the creatures that lurk in the dark corners of Muspelheim, Hel and Midgard.

The project can be expanded exponentially by utilizing the sections already in the different menus and gods, creatures, runes and symbols as well as far more pop culture can be readily available.

This also includes pop culture references which some may frown on, however, though inaccurate, there is no shame in having fun as long as it's not shaming the culture in itself. That is why this project exists, to be able to blend two worlds.

### The Why

_Racism_

There's truly no way to get around the stigma of Norse mythology, its runes and tales without hearing about the racism that's been influenced by it. Or rather, should I say, hijacked by groups who seem to believe
some are more than others based on skin color.
This is not ever mentioned in any part of the mythos or the legends. The goal for many was to reach Asgard and to reach Asgard you needed to be a warrior and anyone can be a warrior.
There's not even mention in the Asatr√∫ (the Norse faith) that you even needed to explicitly worship any of the gods since their powers didn't derive from worship, rather it was the humans that wanted blessings.

_Fascination_

But apart from shining a light on the stigma of racism there's always been a fascination of the Norse mythos that is worth to carry over into the next generations along with the lessons we can teach each other.
The gods themselves are as faulty as any human which means it is very easy to find yourself liking them, hating them or feeling kinship to them.
This along with the 'Warrior Spirit' which we know of, not just from those that went viking but also from those who settled the harsh climates in the east, like Russia, makes us wonder why and how they overcame such hardships.

_The Next Generation_

I've touched on it before but watching social media and hearing peoples opinions on the subject it's very easy to see that there's one side who thinks no one should worship the Aesir or even find the mythos interesting or be
branded a racist, which I believe is the wrong way to go about it.
The other side thinks the mythos belongs to only a few and no one else but people who look like them and think like them should be allowed to use the runes, the names etc. Definitely wrong.

What I'd like for coming generations is to see that a flawed reality is better than a perfect one, just like how the Aesir are flawed and society is flawed and yet we strive to be better.
Skin color, heritage, what is 100% authentic etc should not even matter - the Warrior Spirit, the willingness to fight for your beliefs and stand up for others is to me worth more than finding out who's right.

### The How

_Testing_

I have tested the resolution of different devices ranging from iPhone XR, Samsung S22, iPad Mini and desktop resolution like 1920p and above.
All resolutions tested fairly when it came to visibility and ease of access.

The header menu navigations buttons all tested positive when it came to bringing me back to the home page and moving to the different sections.

I also ran the page through the W3C validation service and through a CSS validator and have found no issues or bugs.

_Languages_

The languages used to create the website is HTML and CSS.

_Software_

The website was built in Codeanywhere and then uploaded to Github. The README.md was created in Github.
TinyPNG to compress images, making them load faster on the page.

### Credits

I'd like to thank my tutor at Code Institute David Calikes for the help and readiness shown and the README.md is also loosely based upon one of his own projects.
