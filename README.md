# Norse Mythology

A passion project created to bring back the positivity, interest and mysticism of the old Norse mythology of Aesir and Vanir, of Ragnarok and the creatures that lurk in the dark corners of Muspelheim, Hel and Midgard.

The project can be expanded exponentially by utilizing the sections already in the different menus and gods, creatures, runes and symbols as well as far more pop culture can be readily available.

This also includes pop culture references which some may frown on, however, though inaccurate, there is no shame in having fun as long as it's not shaming the culture in itself. That is why this project exists, to be able to blend two worlds.
