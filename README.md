## Norse Mythology

A passion project created to bring back the positivity, interest and mysticism of the old Norse mythology of Aesir and Vanir, of Ragnarok and the creatures that lurk in the dark corners of Muspelheim, Hel and Midgard.

The project can be expanded exponentially by utilizing the sections already in the different menus and gods, creatures, runes and symbols as well as far more pop culture can be readily available.
