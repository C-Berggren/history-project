        <h2>Ragnarök</h2>
        Ragnarök, the end of the worlds, the apocalypse.<br>
        While it is unknown when Ragnarök will happen, it is said there will be three years of summer,<br>
        followed by three years of winter, the Fimbul winter.<br>
        The world serpent, Jörmungandr will rise from the seas and waves will crash against the land.<br>
        Surtr, the fire giant, will rise up and bring fire and flame.<br>
        The final battle between gods and giants. One where many of the great legends go to die.<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h2>Fenrir</h2>
        Fenrir is the son of the god Loki and takes the form of an enormous wolf,<br>
        one that grows to be able to swallow the moon. <br>
        Destined to kill and eat the All-Father, Odin, <br>
        to then be pierced by Odin's spear, Gungnirr, wielded by his son Vidar.<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h2>Jörmungandr</h2>
            The world serpent. <br>
            It is said that the snake was so long it stretched across Midgard and able to bite its own tail.<br>
            In the final battle Jörmungandr will fight Thor and in the end get killed, <br>
            however, with only nine steps the god of thunder<br>
            falls as well, dead from the serpent's venom.<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h2>Nidhugg</h2>
            The dragon that gnaws at Yggdrassil's, the world tree's, roots along with her seven mates.<br>
            It's been foretold that after Ragnarök and after Baldr and the humans that survived and whom<br>
            finally have started to build a new kingdom - the dragon of dusk will return.<br>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h2>Surtr</h2>
            The fire giant, the one who wields a blade that glows brighter than the sun and<br>
            whom will steep the world in ash and flame.<br>
            Frey, the Aesir god, pierces Surtr's eye before being felled by the giant's sword.<br>
            Once the world has burned it will plunge into Ginnungagap,<br>
            the nothingness that existed before Odin and his brothers created
            the worlds.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            <h2>Loki</h2>
            The god of mischief. <br>
            Also the father of many of the creatures depicted in Ragnarök.<br>
            Father of both Fenrir and Jörmungandr but also the horse which Odin rides, Sleipnirr,<br>
            but also the goddess of the underworld where souls go who did not die fighting - an after-life<br>
            for crooks, brigands and cowards - Hel. Which is both the name of the goddess and the underworld.<br>
            He will fight alongside his children against the gods after having been punished for causing<br>
            the death of the god Baldr and the giant Tjatse.<br>
            His freedom is the beginning of the end of Ragnarök.<br>
